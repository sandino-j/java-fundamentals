# Car Purchase Simulation 🚗💨

Welcome to **Car Purchase Simulation**! 🎉

This project was developed in **Java** as part of my learning journey, with the goal of **improving my programming skills**, practicing the language fundamentals, and moving towards better coding practices.
It is a **simple project**, but an important step in my growth as a developer.

## 📚 About the project

🔹 The program simulates the purchase of a car in a virtual store.
🔹 The user can choose to buy the car, apply (or not) a discount coupon, and proceed with the payment.
🔹 All interactions happen through the **console**.
🔹 It was created to practice **decision structures, loops, user input with Scanner, and basic programming logic**.

## 🎯 Learning goals

✔️ Strengthen basic Java concepts.
✔️ Practice **input and output handling**.
✔️ Work with **conditions (if/else)** and **loops (while)**.
✔️ Build a functional project, even if simple, as part of my study portfolio.
✔️ Document my progress as a developer.
